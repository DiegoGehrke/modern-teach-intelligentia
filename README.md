- First of all, create an new Chat Gpt account and get your free API Key (You will receive 3 months of free access,
without having to upgrade, the counter starts when you create your account). 
- Then go to: app > src > main > java/com/diego/gehrke/learn/intelligentia > constants > CHAT_API_KEY.kt
- Now, paste your Chat Gpt Api Key on the constant variable API_KEY value;
- You should now be able to interact with the api;
- You should also add a "google-services.json" which is from Firebase;
- The layout of the chat screen (actually all screens) is not very nice, you can try to make it better first XD;
- Just compile the app and have fun.
